   ExecTrace is a linux only debugging tool.  It uses ptrace to track the
   execution of a child program compiled with debugging info.  To use
   ExecTrace you would do something similar to the following:

     gcc testprog.c -o testprog -ggdb
     exectrace ./testprog 
  
   and ExecTrace will generate a (big) file called "exec.log" which
   contains the source lines of your program as it executes.  You may wish
   to tail -f this file as the program is running (perhaps in another
   window of your X session).  This can be useful when you have a program
   that segfaults for no apparent reason and you want to know 1) where the 
   segfault occured and 2) what code was run leading up to the segfault.
